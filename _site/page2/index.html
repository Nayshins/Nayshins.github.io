        Day Three And Mocking

    <p>Yesterday I took a trip to Libertyville, IL to work with my mentor Colin at the 8th Light office there.  This was my first time leaving the city of Chicago since moving here, and it was quite an experience driving through city traffic and torrential rain to get there! The office was nice and quiet with just Colin and I there, and I was able to make some more progress on my Java Tic Tac Toe program.</p>

<p>While I made some solid progress on the application yesterday, I am continuing to have some issues testing the game loop. In order to do so, I will need to roll my own mock classes that respond to methods being called in the game loop. This will allow me to test that the game loop is calling the correct methods, and getting the correct responses I need in order for the game to function properly. However at the moment my mock objects are not up to the task of being tested, and I will need to get over this hurdle in order to continue with the application.</p>

        First Day And Tic Tac Toe
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Sep 2014</span>

    <p>Yesterday was my first day as a resident apprentice at 8th Light, and I will have you know that I only panicked once, the whole morning. My morning started at 9:00 AM when I met my mentor Colin downstairs at the 8th Light offices, and after going over the apprenticeship goals, I received my first apprentice project, which was to create an unbeatable game of Tic Tac Toe in Java. This project also came with the caveat that I must follow the three rules of test driven design (TDD). </p>

<p>Having done some work with Java before, I was aware of the challenge that I had ahead of me. The first time I worked through the unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game, I used Ruby as my programming language of choice because of my familiarity it. While Java is a very large language, I quickly found that I was missing Ruby&#39;s enumerable module and functional blocks. Because of Java&#39;s static typing, what took me only one line in ruby, took much more coding in Java. For example the code to find the index of a certain piece on the board in ruby:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">locations</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">piece</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">#returns the index of &#39;X&#39;, &#39;O&#39;, or &#39; &#39;</span>
    <span class="n">grid</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each_index</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">grid</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">piece</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>compared to Java:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">getLocations</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">locations</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">grid</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">length</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
            <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">grid</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
                <span class="n">locations</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">);</span>
            <span class="o">}</span>
        <span class="o">}</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">locations</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>While Java is much more verbose, the benefit is that I know exactly what the function will return no matter what because of the static typing. </p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve got my first day behind me, I am ready to continue on the Tic Tac Toe project today, and hopefully make it to the point where I can rewrite the Negamax Algorithm in Java.</p>
