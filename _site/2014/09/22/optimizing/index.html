<p>Over the weekend, I spent a fair amount of time researching how to make my Tic Tac Toe algorithm faster on a large board. While I expanded my knowledge on game tree searching algorithms, the actual process of implementing such a process into my algorithm was rather difficult. I spent a few hours this morning trying to implement a transposition table in my Tic Tac Toe algorithm to make it run at a more acceptable speed. A transposition table is a hash-map that stores board state as the key, and all other necessary data as the value. However when I tried to implement it into my algorithm, I was unable to find the proper place to set the key value, and because of this, it caused my algorithm to no longer work as intended. </p>

<p>Transposition tables are normally used in chess algorithms where possible outcomes are orders and orders of magnitude higher than a four by four Tic Tac Toe board, so by using this approach I was essentially trying to kill a fly with a bazooka. While almost on the verge of giving up, I stumbled upon a small error in my alpha beta break. With just this fix, I made my algorithm run at the speeds at which I wanted. </p>

<p>Even though my algorithm is fully backed by automated tests, the error was not able to be picked up by the test suite. This is because it was not a functionality breaking error, but instead, it just caused the alpha beta break not to be called as often as it should have been. The only way to tell if was working as intended was to play the game and see how fast it would run. Even with the error in the alpha beta break, the program ran faster than when it did not have it, so I assumed that everything was working as intended. </p>

<p>In conclusion, check to make sure your code is working as you intended before you start bringing out the bazookas to &quot;fix&quot; it. </p>
