<p>Yesterday was my first day as a resident apprentice at 8th Light, and I will have you know that I only panicked once, the whole morning. My morning started at 9:00 AM when I met my mentor Colin downstairs at the 8th Light offices, and after going over the apprenticeship goals, I received my first apprentice project, which was to create an unbeatable game of Tic Tac Toe in Java. This project also came with the caveat that I must follow the three rules of test driven design (TDD). </p>

<p>Having done some work with Java before, I was aware of the challenge that I had ahead of me. The first time I worked through the unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game, I used Ruby as my programming language of choice because of my familiarity it. While Java is a very large language, I quickly found that I was missing Ruby&#39;s enumerable module and functional blocks. Because of Java&#39;s static typing, what took me only one line in ruby, took much more coding in Java. For example the code to find the index of a certain piece on the board in ruby:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">locations</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">piece</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">#returns the index of &#39;X&#39;, &#39;O&#39;, or &#39; &#39;</span>
    <span class="n">grid</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each_index</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">grid</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">piece</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>compared to Java:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">getLocations</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">locations</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">grid</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">length</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
            <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">grid</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
                <span class="n">locations</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">);</span>
            <span class="o">}</span>
        <span class="o">}</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">locations</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>While Java is much more verbose, the benefit is that I know exactly what the function will return no matter what because of the static typing. </p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve got my first day behind me, I am ready to continue on the Tic Tac Toe project today, and hopefully make it to rewriting the Negamax Algorithm in Java.</p>
