<p>Oh, What a glorious day! That program you have been working on for many days is finally done, and you are now ready to share it with the world. Well almost... While going over your code from the previous day&#39;s work, you have noticed that your code has started to develop a certain odor. This odor should not actually smell (if it does, maybe you need a shower), but instead it is  some working code that could turn into a problem in the future. Take sushi for example, a bad piece of fish is still sushi, but it could lead to (intestinal) problems in the future. Just like bad fish, code smells are something that you want to actively remove from your codebase.</p>

<p>Today during a code review with my mentor, we uncovered a odoriferous method within my Tic Tac Toe game loop.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="k">while</span> <span class="o">(!</span><span class="n">rules</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">gameOver</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">board</span><span class="o">)){</span>

<span class="o">-</span>                <span class="n">console</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">computerMove</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">-</span>                <span class="n">currentPlayer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">makeMove</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">currentPlayer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">unbeatableComputer</span><span class="o">());</span>
<span class="o">-</span>            <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">-</span>            <span class="n">console</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">printBoard</span><span class="o">();</span>
             <span class="n">switchPlayers</span><span class="o">();</span>
         <span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The purpose of the above code is to determine whether the current player is a human or computer, and then call their class specific method to make a move. While the code works, what would happen if the requirements changed, and now an animal player must be added to the game as well? If I were to keep the same code structure it would look something like this :</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="k">while</span> <span class="o">(!</span><span class="n">rules</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">gameOver</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">board</span><span class="o">)){</span>
<span class="o">-</span>            <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">currentPlayer</span> <span class="k">instanceof</span> <span class="n">HumanPlayer</span><span class="o">){</span>
<span class="o">-</span>                <span class="n">currentPlayer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">selectMove</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">-</span>            <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="nf">if</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">currentPlayer</span> <span class="k">instanceof</span> <span class="n">ComputerPlayer</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
<span class="o">-</span>                <span class="n">console</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">computerMove</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">-</span>                <span class="n">currentPlayer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">makeMove</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">currentPlayer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">unbeatableComputer</span><span class="o">());</span>
<span class="o">-</span>            <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="nf">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">currentPlayer</span> <span class="n">instanceOf</span> <span class="n">AnimalPlayer</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
<span class="o">-</span>            <span class="n">currentPlayer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">animalMove</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">-</span>        <span class="o">}</span>    
<span class="o">-</span>            <span class="n">console</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">printBoard</span><span class="o">();</span>
             <span class="n">switchPlayers</span><span class="o">();</span>
         <span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The only way to get this program to continue functioning in it&#39;s current state is to add another statement to the conditional. This is not a sustainable fix to the problem because if another type of player is added to the game, the pattern of adding statements to the conditional will continue, and this method will begin to bloat in size. This is not good, and something has to be done to prevent the coming bloat.</p>

<p>In his book <em>Refactoring</em>, Martin Fowler describes this code smell as: &quot;You have a conditional that chooses different behavior depending on the type of an object.&quot; This statement accurately describes the situation the code is in because the conditional selects the appropriate make move method for each type of object. Luckily, this is a book about refactoring, and Martin gives a solution to refactor the problem code: &quot;Move each leg of the conditional to an overriding method in a subclass. Make the original method abstract.&quot; While his solution makes sense, it uses a bit of jargon, so lets break it down into steps.</p>
