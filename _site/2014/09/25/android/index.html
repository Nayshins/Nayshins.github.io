<p>After completing my second iteration of Tic Tac toe, I was given the next iteration of the application, port it to an android app. This is my first foray in the world of mobile development, and it has gotten off to a slow but steady start. Even though it has gotten off to a slow start, as I am getting used to the android API&#39;s, it had become a much smoother process. One of the challenges I faced even before I could write any code, was to get the android virtual machine working on my computer. As I do not have an android phone, this was the only was for me to execute and interact with the code that I have written so far. Another challenge I faced was learning how to use the XML based layouts for the user interface. It felt a bit clumsy at first, but after some time writing it, it began to feel like I was writing HTML which is very easy to me.</p>

<p>Now that we got the bad parts out of the way, I can talk about what I have enjoyed so far and what I am looking forward to. I am glad that I took the time to figure out how gradle works because it has been an invaluable resource in building my original tic tac toe into a .jar file. Since android uses gradle as well, I was able to quickly set my original code as a dependency and was able to access all of the game methods from within my android app. Once I got it all wired up, I was able to play a simple game of tic tac toe on the VM. Now that I have my simple game working, I need to build it out to be as functional as my console based version. This means that I will need to add a replay function and the ability to run the game on a 4 x 4 board as well.</p>

<p>This leads me to what I am looking forward to the most, using threads to move the game process to run in the background of the main UI thread. I have noticed that the Negamax algorithm runs much slower on the phone than on the computer, and if I did not move it to a background process for a 4 x 4 board, the algorithm will certainly crash the application. I have been doing a lot of reading about threading lately, and I am excited to get my first start on it. </p>
