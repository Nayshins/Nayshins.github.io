<p>Two weeks in, and I am loving every minute of my apprenticeship at 8th Light. This week I have extended my Tic Tac Toe game to be able to play on a 4x4 board, and have set it to allow any combination of human and computer players to play each other. While all of the new features are working, the computer player on the 4x4 is considerably slower than on a 3x3 board. The first few moves by the computer take upwards of 10 seconds, but as the board fills up its choices are near instantaneous. I have been researching a few options on how to speed up the computer player, and the options are: store boards and their values in a hash map, or to use a method called iterative deepening on the negamax tree search. Both options will need more research, but I am leaning towards using the hashing method. </p>

<p>Along with the work  on Tic Tac Toe, I have started reading Clean Code by Bob Martin, and the book is helping me to become more aware of the SOLID principles. I look forward to getting a bunch of reading and research in this weekend on both topics, so I can have some more intellectual fuel for my next blog posts.</p>
