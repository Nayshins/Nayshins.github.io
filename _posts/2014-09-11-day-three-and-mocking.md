Yesterday I took a trip to Libertyville, IL to work with my mentor Colin at the 8th Light office there.  This was my first time leaving the city of Chicago since moving here, and it was quite an experience driving through city traffic and torrential rain to get there! The office was nice and quiet with just Colin and I there, and I was able to make some more progress on my Java Tic Tac Toe program.

While I made some solid progress on the application yesterday, I am continuing to have some issues testing the game loop. In order to do so, I will need to roll my own mock classes that respond to methods being called in the game loop. This will allow me to test that the game loop is calling the correct methods, and getting the correct responses I need in order for the game to function properly. However at the moment my mock objects are not up to the task of being tested, and I will need to get over this hurdle in order to continue with the application.
