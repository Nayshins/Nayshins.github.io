title: Stages of Creative Thought
---

Until I found myself unhappy in my first job, I had never believed that I was a creative person. In a job that did not have any outlet for creativity, I began to search for alternatives, and luckily for me, I found computer programming.

While it may not seem like it at first, programming is as much of a creative exercise as it is an exercise in applied logic. Programming at its core definition is the process of developing an original solution to an existing problem.  This may sound like logical problem solving with the help of a computer, but what is really happening is that you are creating a solution that didn't exist before: creating something from nothing, is creativity. 

Programming has been a boon for my need for a creative outlet, and it has led me to the path to software craftsmanship which I now follow.  As I follow this path, I am always looking to find opportunities to learn a new skill or technique that will help me become a better software developer, and one way I look for such opportunities is to read. I am constantly reading (Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/8556990?shelf=read)), and my reading is not just limited to programming books that are assigned as part of my apprenticeship. I am currently reading the book *The Mission, The Men, and Me*  by Pete Blaber, a former Delta Force commander, and while at first it may seem that a book by a Delta Force commander isn't applicable to software development, a section of this book has radically changed the way I now look at my creative process while programming.

So, how could a book about a special operations soldier change my creative process? In a section of the book, the author is having trouble sleeping during a period of time while he and his team are developing a mission plan. The mission at hand has no simple answers, and with ideas constantly rushing through his mind, he is unable to get any sleep without thinking about solutions. His solution to his insomnia was to go see one of the teams consulting psychologists, and this is what he was told:

>You need to understand how the human mind works. The mind has three elementary phases it goes through when it's thinking: saturate, incubate, and illuminate. Although they generally occur in order, all three are continuous processes, so your mind is constantly cycling through all three phases. The saturation phase occurs when the mind if first exposed to something. When you're planning a new mission, you're saturating your mind with facts, assumptions, insights and/or sensory cues - ergo, the saturation phase. the next phase is incubation. This is a critical phase if you ever want to come up with something innovative. The mind needs time to incubate. During this phase the mind subconsciously sorts through all of the inputs and begins to recognize patterns and snap those patterns together to come up with concepts and ideas. This is why you may have heard people say, 'I need to sleep on it' before making a major decision. It's not the sleep per se that they need: it's the time to allow their mind to sort through information and search for patterns. The recognition of patterns that occurs during the incubation phase produces the illumination phase, also known as 'eureka' moments, when your mind begins to translate those patterns and form the into actionable ideas. Saturate, incubate, illuminate - it's how the mind works, and it's probably the main reason why you have last so much sleep over the years. The best thing you can do is to keep a pen and paper by your bed. Writing down your thoughts while you're incubating and illuminating should help to temporarily get the off your mind and back to sleep.
>*The Mission, The Men, and Me* (Page 70)

Of all the takeaways I have gotten from this book, this resonated with me the most because I can recall many nights going home after working on a tough problem, and not being able to sleep that night because all I could think about was the problem at hand.  My brain was subconsciously attempting to solve the problem, and I wasn't relieving the space for it to do so by writing down my ideas! This lead me to do more research on the creative process, and how I can fully apply it to my work as a software developer.

### Saturation

*While I am calling these steps, they do not have to come in order, and two of them can be going on at the same time.*

Saturation is the first step in the creative process, and it begins when the challenge or problem has been encountered. Before I realized this was a step in the process, my first step was to read as much as I could about the problem or other solutions, so that I could begin to build a model of what I wanted to build in my head. This is often a point where many people feel clueless about what they are going to do because there are so many options, and in turn just as many possible side effects of each solution. 

When I was assigned my first apprenticeship project, an unbeatable game of Tic Tac Toe in Java, this is how I felt. I had a complicated problem with vague requirements that I had to solve, but along with it, I also had to learn the inner workings of a very large programming language. I unknowingly entered the saturation phase, and I felt overwhelmed because of all the information that I was taking in without coming up with a solution. 

### Incubation

Incubation doesn't actually begin until you have walked away from the problem at hand. Once you distract your active mind from the problem, your subconscious can begin to uncover patterns in the data that you have gathered while saturating. One of the best ways that I have found to get my mind off of a problem is to get my blood pumping, and luckily for us at 8th Light, we have a ping pong table in the office that is very effective at detaching you from the problems you were just working on. While detaching yourself from the problem is an important step in the process, sometimes incubation can manifest itself while you are try to relax. This is the stage that keeps you up at night because your brain keeps going over the information you have until it has found a strong pattern.

### Illumination

Illumination is the eureka moment you feel when your brain has had enough time to incubate and it can form a full idea for you to act on. These ideas rarely bubble up while you are working on the problem, but instead they normally appear while you are doing monotonous tasks or relaxing. This is why staring at your problem and not walking away from it for hours on end is less beneficial than taking breaks: you are preventing your subconscious mind from compiling your choices into tangible ideas by forcing it to concentrate on the problem itself instead of the data and patterns you have uncovered. When you have an illumination, it is best to write it down to prevent yourself losing any sleep or becoming anxious. 

### Verification

Lastly, we have the verification step, and this is when you act on the ideas that you have developed during the process. Not all of the ideas that you have during an illumination will work, and in this stage you test your ideas to see if they are valid. As a software craftsman this is the step when you test and write your code, and whether or not it works, you will begin the process over again with a new idea.

### Takeaway

The realization that difficult problems take time to solve and with greater knowledge of the steps involved in making creative decisions, I now have a deeper insight into my creative process. I have added a new toolset to recognize what stage of thought my brain is in, and now know how to effectively coax solutions from the apparent chaos of creative thought.
